Is Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are 
anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as 
another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
Output: false

Constraints:

    s and t consist of lowercase English letters.



Need to use .get() on right hand side

for char in s:
    hm_s[char] = hm_s.get(char, 0) + 1

because hm_s[char] may not have been initialized yet.

op python grammer
return hm_s == hm_t
