String Encode and Decode

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. 
The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of 
strings.

Please implement encode and decode

Example 1:
Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]
Output:["neet","code","love","you"]

Example 2:
Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]
Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Constraints:

    0 <= strs.length < 100
    0 <= strs[i].length < 200
    strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.



UTF-8 characters includes whitespace and other special 
characters like !@#$%^&*() so using these as a delimiter 
does not work, as input str might contain them.

Encode and Decode is a two separate function, if we are allowed 
to use global variables, we may be able to store the word count 
in an array or hashmap but if we were to deal them between two 
Encode and Decode functions we have modify the encoding string.
