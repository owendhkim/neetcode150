Top K Elements in List

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most 
frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

You may return the output in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1
Output: [7]

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
    -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.



This creates 2d List
buckets = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]

for i in range(len(buckets) - 1, 0, -1):
0 tells it to stop at 0
-1 tells it to iterate from the back

buckets = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]
+ 1 is necessary here because count will be never 0, so we 
need another bucket that will make up for waste of one slot
