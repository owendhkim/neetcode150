Duplicate Integer

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than 
once in the array, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: false



Add all elements the list O(n)

Hash function allows lookup time to be O(1)
tradeoff - memory complexity O(n) 

Data strucutres like array,arraylist are index based
If index is known lookup will be o(1) but in this case, we do not
we have to lookup by elements and that will be a linear search o(n)

Both hashmap and hashset works but hashmap takes more space by storing 
key-value pair, hashset only take in elements.

Array Space Complexity: O(1)
Fixed Size: An array’s space complexity is O(1) because it uses a 
fixed amount of space regardless of the number of elements it holds. 
When you declare an array, you allocate a specific amount of memory 
for it.

HashMap Space Complexity: O(n)
Dynamic Size: A HashMap’s space complexity is O(n) because it grows 
dynamically with the number of key-value pairs it stores. Each new 
entry (key-value pair) requires additional space.
